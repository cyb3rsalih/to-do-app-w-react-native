Simple ToDo App w/ React Native 


# How to run the project 

#### 1- Install essentials from [React Native Offical Page](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

#### 2- Install dependencies 
##### Node Modules  

`$ cd ProjectFile`  
`$ npm install`  


##### Google Admob Integration

[React Native Admob Component](https://github.com/sbugert/react-native-admob)  

#### 3- Run Project
`react-native run-ios --port=8088`  

## Notes
Don't forget to Enable `Live Reload` with `CMD + D`  
The default port for this project is `8081` but I have some issues with this port, probably you will also. `8088` works stable
